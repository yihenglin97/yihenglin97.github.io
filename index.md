I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at California Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). My research interests are online learning, control, and reinforcement learning.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate program in Computer Science and Technology at Andrew Chi-Chih Yaoâ€™s CS pilot class at [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I was advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g9d_K0sAAAAJ&hl=en).
